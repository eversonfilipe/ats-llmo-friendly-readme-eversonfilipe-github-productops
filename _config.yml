description: >-
  Systems Analyst and Technical Implementation Specialist focused on Software Lifecycle and SaaS process automation. I operate at the intersection of business requirements and software execution, configuring high-scalability solutions for Tier-1 infrastructure concessionaires such as Ecovias and Arteris. My technical foundation is built on a Computer Science degree and strategic global leadership through the Aspire Leaders Program.
  In just 4 months, I delivered 171 critical technical tasks, representing 32.11% of the teams total output. I utilize Python, Django Admin, and JSONLogic to configure operational units with 100% data integrity and logical validation. Beyond technical execution, I designed reusable Model Units that standardized setup and optimized backend scripts, resulting in real efficiency gains and operational agility.
  My approach combines the rigor of Technical Troubleshooting and advanced SQL with Lean Thinking and Scrum agility. I structure workflows within the Atlassian ecosystem (Jira/Confluence) and ClickUp to ensure total traceability and high-quality technical documentation. I have a proven track record of leading technical onboarding for cohorts like GROWUP and SOFTEX, accelerating the integration of new talent into production.
  Im seeking new challenges to lead Digital Transformation and Cloud-Native Implementation projects. I specialize in REST API Integrations (Postman) and AWS EC2 environments, focused on delivering quantifiable results and technical excellence.
  Lets connect to discuss how I can scale your results.
