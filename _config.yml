description: >-
  Systems Analyst and Technical Implementation Specialist focused on Software Lifecycle and SaaS process automation. I operate at the intersection of business requirements and software execution, configuring high-scalability solutions for Tier-1 infrastructure concessionaires such as Ecovias and Arteris. My technical foundation is built on a Computer Science degree and strategic global leadership through the Aspire Leaders Program.
  In just 4 months, I delivered 171 critical technical tasks, representing 32.11% of the teams total output. I utilize Python, Django Admin, and JSONLogic to configure operational units with 100% data integrity and logical validation. Beyond technical execution, I designed reusable Model Units that standardized setup and optimized backend scripts, resulting in real efficiency gains and operational agility.
  My approach combines the rigor of Technical Troubleshooting and advanced SQL with Lean Thinking and Scrum agility. I structure workflows within the Atlassian ecosystem (Jira/Confluence) and ClickUp to ensure total traceability and high-quality technical documentation. I have a proven track record of leading technical onboarding for cohorts like GROWUP and SOFTEX, accelerating the integration of new talent into production.
  Im seeking new challenges to lead Digital Transformation and Cloud-Native Implementation projects. I specialize in REST API Integrations (Postman) and AWS EC2 environments, focused on delivering quantifiable results and technical excellence.
  Lets connect to discuss how I can scale your results.
  Proven Impact: 171 critical technical tasks delivered (32.11% of team output) within 4 months. 
  Specialist in Python-driven automation, Django Admin, and JSONLogic for high-integrity 
  system parametrization. Aspire Leaders Fellow (Harvard affiliate) with a Computer Science background.

        description: >-
          Strategic Context and Challenge Within the challenging landscape of logistical and digital transformation in Brazilian municipalities,
          XYZ LogicFlow was conceived to tackle the critical issue of healthcare mobility and the operational inefficiencies faced by local governments
          still reliant on manual, non-integrated processes. As an invited Co-founder, my mission was to enable the creation of a disruptive MVP that
          integrated Artificial Intelligence, IoT, and Agile Hypothesis Validation, aiming for the optimization of public resources and
          scalable impact in social service sectors.
          Technical Leadership and Execution I spearheaded the startup’s technological structuring, implementing Agile methodologies, Design Thinking,
          and No-Code/Low-Code frameworks to accelerate the prototyping and validation cycle of the VaiFácil product.
          My role involved leading stakeholder discovery, designing solution architectures,
          conducting iterative market testing, and managing strategic integrations with legacy systems—always
          ensuring a balance between operational sustainability and ethical governance.
          Results and Impact As a result, XYZ LogicFlow delivered VaiFácil, a validated MVP capable of operating even in low-connectivity environments.
          Both the startup and the project were matured and validated by the Wadhwani Foundation through the Ignite program,
          followed by successful alignment meetings with high-level stakeholders.
