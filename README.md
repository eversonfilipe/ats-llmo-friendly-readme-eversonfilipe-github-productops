### 👨‍💻 About Me

We live in an era of data abundance, but a scarcity of insights. My mission is to close that gap. I am a Data Product Operations Specialist focused on one central goal: transforming raw information into scalable Decision Intelligence.

I don’t just manage data; I operationalize it. Positioned at the critical intersection between Technology (SQL, API, ETL) and Business Strategy, I act as the essential “translator” ensuring engineering efforts are perfectly aligned with organizational goals. My approach goes beyond traditional Business Intelligence—which tells you what happened—to deliver true Decision Intelligence, empowering leaders to know what to do next.

#### My Value Proposition:
- Strategic Alignment: I decode complex business requirements into actionable Agile User Stories for technical teams, ensuring full alignment across stakeholders.
- Operational Excellence: I build data products that are governed, secure, and scalable, reducing technical debt and accelerating the time-to-insight.
- Global Leadership: As a Fellow of the Aspire Leaders Program (ALP ’25), founded by faculty from Harvard Business School, i bring an empathetic, globally minded leadership style to cross-functional teams.

I thrive in complex environments where I can leverage SQL and API Integration to build the infrastructure, while using Product Strategy to design the value flow. If you're looking for a partner to turn data chaos into competitive advantage, let’s connect.
